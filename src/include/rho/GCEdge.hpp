    /** @brief Directed edge in the graph whose nodes are GCNode objects.
 *
 * This class encapsulates a pointer from one GCNode to another,
 * and carries out housekeeping required by the garbage collection
 * scheme.  The class name reflects the fact that these objects
 * represent directed edges in the directed graph with the GCNode
 * objects as its nodes.
 *
 * Whenever an object of a type derived from GCNode needs to refer
 * to another such object, it should do so by containing a GCEdge
 * object, rather than by containing a pointer or reference
 * directly.
 *
 * @tparam T GCNode or a type publicly derived from GCNode.  This
 *           may be qualified by const, so for example a const
 *           String* may be encapsulated in a GCEdge using the type
 *           GCEdge<const String>.
