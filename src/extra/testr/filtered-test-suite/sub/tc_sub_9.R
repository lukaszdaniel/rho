See\\n?LocalReferenceClasses.\\n\\n\\036untar() has a new argument restore_times which if false (not the\\ndefault) discards the times in the tarball.  This is useful if they\\nare incorrect (some tarballs submitted to CRAN have times in a\\nlocal timezone or many years in the past even though the standard\\nrequired them to be in UTC).\\n\\n\\036replayplot() cannot (and will not attempt to) replay plots recorded\\nunder R < 3.0.0.  It may crash the R session if an attempt is made\\nto replay plots created in a different build of R >= 3.0.0.\\n\\n\\036Palette changes get recorded on the display list, so replaying\\nplots (including when resizing screen devices and using dev.copy())\\nwill work better when the palette is changed during a plot.\\n\\n\\036chol(pivot = TRUE) now defaults to LAPACK, not LINPACK.\\n\\n\\036The parse() function has a new parameter keep.source, which\\ndefaults to options(\\\"keep.source\\\").\\n\\n\\036Profiling via Rprof() now optionally records information at the\\nstatement level, not just the function level.\\n\\n\\036The Rprof() function now quotes function names in in its output\\nfile on Windows, to be consistent with the quoting in Unix.\\n\\n\\036Profiling via Rprof() now optionally records information about time\\nspent in GC.\\n\\n\\036The HTML help page for a package now displays non-vignette\\ndocumentation files in a more accessible format.\\n\\n\\036To support options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE), model.frame(),\\nmodel.matrix() and replications() now automatically convert\\ncharacter vectors to factors without a warning.\\n\\n\\036The print method for objects of class \\\"table\\\" now detects tables\\nwith 0-extents and prints the results as, e.g., < table of extent 0\\nx 1 x 2 >. (Wish of PR#15198.)\\n\\n\\036Deparsing involving calls to anonymous functions and has been made\\ncloser to reversible by the addition of extra parentheses.\\n\\n\\036The function utils::packageName() has been added as a lightweight\\nversion of methods::getPackageName().\\n\\n\\036find.package(lib.loc = NULL) now treats loaded namespaces\\npreferentially in the same way as attached packages have been for a\\nlong time.\\n\\n\\036In Windows, the Change Directory dialog now defaults to the current\\nworking directory, rather than to the last directory chosen in that\\ndialog.\\n\\n\\036available.packages() gains a \\\"license/restricts_use\\\" filter which\\nretains only packages for which installation can proceed solely\\nbased on packages which are guaranteed not to restrict use.\\n\\n\\036New check_packages_in_dir() function in package tools for\\nconveniently checking source packages along with their reverse\\ndependencies.\\n\\n\\036R's completion mechanism has been improved to handle help requests\\n(starting with a question mark).  In particular, help prefixes are\\nnow supported, as well as quoted help topics.  To support this,\\ncompletion inside quotes are now handled by R by default on all\\nplatforms.\\n\\n\\036The memory manager now allows the strategy used to balance garbage\\ncollection and memory growth to be controlled by setting the\\nenvironment variable R_GC_MEM_GROW. See ?Memory for more details.\\n\\n\\036(‘For experts only’, as the introductory manual says.)  The use of\\nenvironment variables R_NSIZE and R_VSIZE to control the initial (=\\nminimum) garbage collection trigger for number of cons cels and\\nsize of heap has been restored: they can be overridden by the\\ncommand-line options --min-nsize and --min-vsize; see ?Memory.\\n\\n\\036On Windows, the device name for bitmap devices as reported by\\n.Device and .Devices no longer includes the file name.  This is for\\nconsistency with other platforms and was requested by the lattice\\nmaintainer.\\n\\nwin.metafile() still uses the file name: the exact form is used by\\npackage tkrplot.\\n\\n\\036set.seed(NULL) re-initializes .Random.seed as done at the beginning\\nof the session if not already set.  (Suggestion of Bill Dunlap.)\\n\\n\\036The breaks argument in hist.default() can now be a function that\\nreturns the breakpoints to be used (previously it could only return\\nthe suggested number of breakpoints).\\n\\n\\036File share/licenses/licenses.db has some clarifications, especially\\nas to which variants of ‘BSD’ and ‘MIT’ is intended and how to\\napply them to packages.  The problematic licence ‘Artistic-1.0’ has\\nbeen removed.\\n\", FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)"));
